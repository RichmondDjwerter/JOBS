# Job Finder

Thsi Is a UI for a Job Finder Application created using JetPack Compose

 This is project was made to better my UI Skills

 First; this UI was based on a project i found on dribble {https://dribbble.com/shots/19412428-Job-Finder-App}
 and tried to work around it.
 for obvious reasons such as, diffrence in picures; Both project wont look alike
 But for the most part, i think i real tried.

 This project does not have any proper functionality 
 I would love it if someone took upon this projetc 
 and properly developed all of its functionality

 I might come back sometime later to update this project with the functionality
 but that wont be for months as i have other projects to work one!

 It was fun making it and i hope who ever tries to make the functioanlity have as much fun with it as i have

 PS: The Architecture is a Mess.
